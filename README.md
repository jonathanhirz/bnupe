use this project/repo to make changes to the default empty project folder

to create a new project, clone this project [git@bitbucket.org:jonathanhirz/_empty.git] into a new folder, or copy paste folder, doesn't matter.
remember, git folder comes with it either way, so you need to point git/remote to the new repo before pushing changes.
